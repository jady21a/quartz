Maybe sometimes I don’t express myself clearly.
- religion
	- I think people rally around hating others that are different from them.
	- It is easy to turn that into anger.
A：
I don't know much about religion, so I don't know why different religions conflict with each other.
People will instinctively like people who are the same as themselves or have similar experiences

- money
A：

- practical wisdom
	- I am reading on the Unity of Knowledge and Action. I disagree with a point. He argues that someone can say cheating is wrong, but then actually cheats, that person doesn't actually believe it is wrong. I disagree.  I think people do things they know are wrong.
A：
Know and agree
Maybe he knows from teachers or the public that cheating is wrong, and he thinks so on the surface, but in his heart he may think it doesn't matter.
Would you do something that you don't accept from the bottom of your heart?

- Are people intrinsically good, or is good behavior learned?
A：


- 跟自己深度鏈結  Connect deeply with your inner self.

可以信奉宗教，但是不能被管理统治

seat
- I believe I need to change the rip stitch harness to start tearing earlier so the kid doesn't experience as much of a shock   vendor change
- We tried changing the timing of when the kid experience forces in Z and Y.  Didn't work
- And we tried holding the kid tighter.  Didn't work
- And we tried adding foam to harness. Didn't work.


人总是想要没有的，怀念失去的，活在当下

High chest G-values typically indicate that the child's chest experiences excessive deceleration during a crash, potentially leading to severe chest injuries. Here are some strategies and directions that might help reduce chest G-values, hopefully providing you with new ideas:

**I. Energy Absorption and Dissipation Design**

Even if you've tried adding foam to the harness, simple padding in a single location may not be sufficient to manage crash energy. Consider the following aspects:

1. **Overall Energy Absorption Design of the Seat Shell:**
    
    - **Material Selection and Structural Design:** Consider using materials with better energy absorption properties for the seat shell, such as certain engineering plastics (e.g., polycarbonate PC, ABS/PC alloys) or composite materials (e.g., Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics CFRP. Although costly, some research indicates its benefits in reducing chest acceleration in specific scenarios).
    - **Structural Optimization:** Design specific crumple zones or energy-absorbing structures within the seat shell. These areas can deform during a crash to absorb and dissipate energy, rather than transferring it directly to the child.
    - **Layered Energy Absorption:** Employ a combination of energy-absorbing materials with different densities and characteristics to create a graded energy absorption system.
2. **Optimization of Liners and Padding:**
    
    - **Types and Thickness of Energy-Absorbing Foam:** Experiment with different types of energy-absorbing foam (e.g., EPP, EPS, high-density polyurethane foam) and optimize their thickness and shape in critical areas (such as in front of the chest and in side wings). Some experimental cushion designs have been shown to reduce chest acceleration.
    - **Multi-Density Foam Combinations:** In areas contacting the child's chest, consider using a combination of foams—softer on the outside and firmer on the inside, or multiple layers of varying hardness—to achieve better cushioning and force distribution.
3. **Synergistic Action of the Restraint System and the Seat:**
    
    - Ensure that the anchoring points of the restraint system (safety belts/shoulder straps) are designed to effectively transfer forces to the energy-absorbing structures of the seat, rather than relying solely on the limited stretch of the harness itself.

**II. Optimization of Restraint System Geometry and Dynamic Response**

1. **Shoulder Strap Angle and Position:**
    
    - **Shoulder Strap Routing Path:** Optimize the path and angle of the shoulder straps from where they emerge from the seatback to the child's shoulders. Improper angles can cause the straps to exert excessive pressure or cutting forces on the chest during a crash.
    - **Shoulder Strap Height Adjustment:** Ensure the shoulder strap height adjustment mechanism can accurately fit children of different heights, so the straps are always in the correct position (at or slightly above the shoulder).
2. **Design of Chest Pad / Chest Clip:**
    
    - **Shape and Stiffness:** If a chest clip is used, its shape, size, and stiffness influence force distribution. An overly rigid chest clip might concentrate stress. Investigate wider, more ergonomic chest clip designs and evaluate whether they contribute to increased chest G-values during a crash.
    - **Sliding Performance:** Some designs allow the chest clip to slide to a certain extent during a crash, which might help distribute concentrated forces from the shoulder straps.
3. **Load Limiters:**
    
    - Integrate load limiters into the harness system. These devices allow the webbing to extend or slip slightly when a preset tension is reached, thereby reducing the peak force transmitted to the child's chest. This is a mature technology in vehicle seatbelts and its application in child seat restraint systems can be explored.

**III. Control of Child's Movement and Posture Within the Seat**

1. **Anti-Submarining Design:**
    
    - Ensure the child does not slide under the lap belt during a frontal collision (submarining effect). Submarining is not only dangerous but can also cause the harness to load the chest and abdomen in unintended ways. This can be achieved by optimizing the shape of the seat cushion's front edge, and the design and position of the crotch strap.
2. **Head Excursion Control and Overall Posture:**
    
    - While chest G-value is the focus, the child's overall kinematics during a crash are interconnected. Excessive head forward excursion can also indirectly affect chest loading. Optimize the headrest, side wings, etc., to limit excessive body displacement while allowing for necessary cushioning.
3. **Seat Installation Angle:**
    
    - As some studies indicate, the installation angle of a child safety seat can affect passenger protection. Ensure your testing and design consider the recommended range of installation angles for the seat in a vehicle.

**IV. Testing and Simulation Analysis**

1. **Refined Finite Element Analysis (FEA):**
    
    - Use more detailed dummy models and seat models for crash simulations. Focus on analyzing chest loading, deformation, and energy transfer paths during the crash.
    - Iteratively optimize different design parameters (e.g., material properties, structural geometry, foam characteristics) through simulation.
2. **Detailed Analysis of Sensor Data:**
    
    - Carefully analyze the tri-axial data from the dummy's chest accelerometers and the resultant acceleration during crash tests. Understand the timing of G-value peaks, their duration, and the primary direction of forces.
    - Analyze chest displacement data to understand the extent of chest compression.
3. **Component-Level Testing:**
    
    - Conduct separate dynamic impact tests on the seat's key energy-absorbing components (e.g., specific areas of the shell, foam liners) to verify if their energy absorption performance meets design expectations.

**V. Other Factors to Consider**

1. **Latest Requirements of Standards and Regulations:**
    
    - Ensure your design targets meet or exceed relevant safety standards (e.g., GB 27887 in China, ECE R44/R129 in Europe, FMVSS 213 in the US). Some technical specifications, for instance, for high-speed child car seats, mention requirements for chest composite acceleration.
2. **Multi-Body Dynamics Simulation:**
    
    - Conduct multi-body dynamics simulations combining dummy models and seat models to study the complex interactions between the child, the seat, and the restraint system during a crash.

Given that you've already ruled out several initial solutions, addressing the high chest G-value issue may require a combination of improvements from one or more of the directions mentioned above. It is advisable to adopt a systematic engineering approach, accurately identifying the root cause of the problem through precise simulation analysis, and then carrying out targeted design iterations and experimental verification.

Hopefully, these suggestions will provide you with valuable insights. If you can offer more information about your current design, test conditions, or specific failure modes, a more targeted analysis might be possible.
